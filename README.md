# Altamont Sample Interview Project
Thank you for taking the time to apply to Altamont Company.  To better understand our tech stack and what daily tasks would look like, this sample project has been prepared.

Completion of this is not timed; 100% completion is also not required.  Instead, this is meant as a starting point for the conversation of what programming duties look like.  Anything left incomplete isn't a demerit but an opportunity to learn and discuss.  It is highly unlikely any candidate would have experience in every single technology discussed here - what's important is a willingness to learn and a tenacity to overcome unexpected problems.
